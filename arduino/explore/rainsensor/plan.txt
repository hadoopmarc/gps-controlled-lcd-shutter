B+B Thermo-Technik rain sensor -> see datasheet

- keep plug links as the factory setting (with heating on; close the relay when wet conditions occur)
- use existing 12V power supply, connect using an available contraplug
- connect REL CO to GND from Arduino
- connect REL NO to pin D2 from Arduino (programmed as pull-up, see
  https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/generic/digital-input-pullup/)


Current 3-wire cable:
- blue: GND from Arduino to ground and REL CO of rain sensor
- brown: +12 V from Vin Arduino to rain sensor
- green/yellow: D2 from Arduino to REL NO of rain sensor
